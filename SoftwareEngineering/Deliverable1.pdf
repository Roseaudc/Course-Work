Our team has decided to use Martus because of how the open-source project allowed individuals in
countries that are experiencing war or any other type of conflict to report firsthand what they see. It is
also written in a language, Java, each of our group members are familiar with, so that makes it easier to
read and test code. In the beginning, we attempted to run the desktop version of Martus but ran into
difficulty when trying to download eclipse on a virtual machine. Operating Eclipse was time
consuming due to it "moving slow" and not compiling the code since Martus was created on an older
version of Eclipse. We also considered using an older version of Martus as our project since we were
able to get it to run, however, we could not find the source code for it.
We decided to change from the desktop to the android app version of Martus since the desktop
version was to difficult to compile. The project has a directory with instructions to set up and run the
app in the their repository. The instruction were straightforward as what the user should do. First we
had to download the Android Studios onto Linux. One of our teammates ran into a small problem at
this point and had to install a few libraries in order to finish the download. Here are the lines of code if
you encounter the same problem: sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32stdc++6. After,
download and import the source code from the Martus repository. The code ran smoothly afterwards,
but Android would freeze from time to time.
After sometime exploring the project we were able to find some gradle scripts that would run several
tests for the project, and return in the event log whether or not certain sections of tests passed. While
we were able to find the individual classes that would test a certain condition, we have not been able to
run them individually and record the results. One of the problems that would arise when trying to run
some tests individually without gradle was a runtime error with the message “Stub!”.
